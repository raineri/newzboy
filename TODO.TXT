- send a private message to user if error occurs
- send a private message to user when download starts
- send a private message to user when download finishes
- support more then 1 server. if segment x isnt in server a,
  then download in server b, if that fails server c, etc..
- when we get currupt segment, subtract the segment from the total file size to get 
  the new file size. update the gui to fix the false percentage/eta prediction
- add bandwidth limit functionality (delay in between reads)
- save last location of window to file, then load the window in that location when
  the gui loads up
- write into .nfo files more detailed explanation of verication errors
- check bookmarks every 10 mins, but check autoload directory every x minutes
- make a gui for the config file
- in downloadgui.py override MainLoop() and exit safely (gui thread currently 
  just hangs)
- if there is a conflict while verifying (more then 1 initial par2 file) then
  download all the par2 files so the user can check it manually.
  OR
  check each individual par2 file
- remove .1 files after verification
- memory leak when loading big nzb files (5MB file results in over 200MB mem)
